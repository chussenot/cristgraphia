# cristgraphia

...an old index full of mystery that the cistercian monks used to make 
an inventory of their library serves as a pretext for an encryption game. 
Many ideas are behind it, such as the way the Easter Island natives used to write... snail-shaped.

This project is a port of a previous [`ruby` version]()
